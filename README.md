# StashCLI

A TypeScript CLI tool to backup and restore folders with encryption support.

I made this tool to manage external backups of important folders on my computer. This project was also submitted to [Hack Club's](https://hackclub.com/) [Clutter](https://clutter.hackclub.com/) You-Ship-We-Ship Programme.

## Features

- Backup folders to a specified directory with encryption.
- Restore folders from backups.

- Command-line interface.

   ```bash

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Run `tsc` to compile the TypeScript files.
